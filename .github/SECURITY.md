## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.

Instead, report them via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Provide a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and potential impact

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a resolution timeline.
